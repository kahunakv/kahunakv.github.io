Kahuna provides building blocks to help construct distributed systems. The **key/value store** can be used to store **configuration, service discoverability,
metadata, caching, sessions, and more**. In this tutorial, you will learn how it works.

## Starting Kahuna

Before you proceed, make sure that Kahuna is running on your system. Refer to the **[Server Installation](server-installation)** section for instructions.
You will also need the **[Kahuna CLI](kahuna-cli)** to execute commands on the server.

After installing the necessary components, run the following command:

```bash
~> kahuna-cli --version
```

## Setting and Retrieving Keys

Within the Kahuna CLI, you can execute commands, transactions, and scripts. Use the following format to set and retrieve key/value pairs:

```visual-basic
~> kahuna-cli
Kahuna Shell 0.0.1 (alpha)

kahuna-cli> set myconfig "my-value"
r0 set 9ms

kahuna-cli> get myconfig
r0 my-value 7ms

kahuna-cli> set myconfig "my-value-2"
r1 set 7ms

kahuna-cli> get myconfig
r1 my-value-2 6ms
```

The `set` command stores key/value pairs durably in the cluster. Internally, the system uses consistent hashing to redirect the request to the leader
node of the corresponding Raft group, which coordinates the operation, achieves consensus, and ensures durable storage and replication. The `get`
command retrieves the most recent value consistently from the appropriate leader node.

## Expiration

By default, keys persisted to disk do not expire. However, you can specify an expiration time so that keys are removed after a defined period. You
can set an expiration when creating a key or modify it later using the `extend` command:

```visual-basic
kahuna-cli> set myconfig "my-value" ex 30000
r2 set 18ms

kahuna-cli> set myconfig "my-value"
r3 set 20ms

kahuna-cli> extend myconfig 30000
r3 extended 16ms
```

Expiration times are specified in milliseconds.

## Durability

By default, Kahuna ensures strong durability by replicating the key/value pairs across many instances. The client is notified of a successful operation
only after receiving confirmation from the majority of nodes in the cluster.

In high-performance scenarios or when working with ephemeral data, on-disk durability may not be necessary or practical. For these cases, Kahuna offers
an "ephemeral" durability mode, in which data is stored only in the leader node's volatile memory.

Commands using ephemeral durability are prefixed with an "e". For example:

```visual-basic
kahuna-cli> eset tempconfig "my-value"
r0 set 47ms

kahuna-cli> eget tempconfig
r0 my-value 32ms
```

Keep in mind that ephemeral data will be lost if the node crashes or if memory pressure forces the system to free up space by removing the least-used keys.
You can also specify an explicit expiration time for ephemeral keys. Ephemeral storage provides faster operations without the overhead of replication
and persistence.

## Revisions

Each time a key is updated, you will notice an incrementing revision number (e.g., r0, r1, etc.). This value, known as the revision, is a monotonic
version number that tracks when a key was last modified. Every time a key is updated or deleted, its revision increments, ensuring strong
consistency and strict ordering.

```visual-basic
kahuna-cli> set myconf "some config"
r0 set 20ms

kahuna-cli> set myconf "some other config"
r1 set 10ms

kahuna-cli> set myconf "another config"
r2 set 15ms

kahuna-cli> get myconf
r2 another config 13ms
```

## Compare And Swap (CAS)

The Compare-And-Swap (CAS) operation ensures atomic updates and prevents race conditions in environments where multiple clients may attempt to modify the same key simultaneously.

```visual-basic
kahuna-cli> set myconf "prev config"
r0 set 14ms

kahuna-cli> set myconf "new config" cmp "prev config"
r1 set 18ms

kahuna-cli> set myconf "some config" cmp "prev config"
r1 not set 13ms
```

## Scripts and Transactions

Kahuna offers a scripting system that allows executing distributed transactions on the key/value store. Scripts can be run from an application using
the appropriate connector for a programming language/platform or directly from `kahuna-cli`. Transactions allow executing multiple operations
(such as modifying or consistently reading keys across multiple nodes) and are applied in an **all-or-nothing** manner.

For example, if we wanted to decrement the value of one key based on the limit configured in another key, we could do the following:

```visual-basic
kahuna-cli>  set max_rate_limit 100
r0 set 13ms

kahuna-cli> let limit = get max_rate_limit
       ...> let current_rate = get rate_limit_user1
       ...>
       ...> if current_rate <= 0 then
       ...>  throw "Rate limit exceeded. Please try again later."
       ...> end
       ...>
       ...> let new_current_rate = current_rate - 1
       ...> set current_rate new_current_rate ex 60000
       ...>
       ...> return new_current_rate
r1 99 18ms

kahuna-cli> get rate_limit_user1
r1 99 4ms
```

In this other example, weâ€™re going to make a transfer between two keys. The keys may or may not be led by the same node, but the transaction
coordinator ensures that changes are applied across all participating nodes. If an error occurs, the transaction will abort and no changes will be applied:

```visual-basic
kahuna-cli>  set balance_user1 1000 nx
r0 set 14ms

kahuna-cli>  set balance_user2 1000 nx
r0 set 12ms

kahuna-cli> begin
       ...>  let balance_user1_value = get balance_user1
       ...>  let balance_user2_value = get balance_user2
       ...>
       ...>  let balance_user1_num = to_int(balance_user1_value)
       ...>  let balance_user2_num = to_int(balance_user2_value)
       ...>
       ...>  if balance_user1_num > 0 then
       ...>     set balance_user1 balance_user1_num - 50
       ...>     set balance_user2 balance_user2_num + 50
       ...>     commit
       ...>  end
       ...> end

r1 set 24ms
```

This ensures **atomicity and consistency** across distributed nodes.
