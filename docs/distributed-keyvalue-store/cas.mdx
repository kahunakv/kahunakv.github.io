# Compare-And-Swap (CAS)

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

A Compare-And-Swap (CAS) operation is critical in a distributed key-value store like Kahuna because it ensures atomic updates and prevents race conditions in environments where multiple clients may try to modify the same key simultaneously. CAS is an atomic operation that:

 - Compares a key’s current value (or version) against an expected value or revision
 - Only updates the key if the current value matches the expected value or revision
 - Fails safely if another process modified the key in the meantime.

| **Use Case** | **How CAS Helps** |
|-------------|------------------|
| **Leader Election** | Ensures only one node becomes leader. |
| **Distributed Locks** | Prevents multiple nodes from acquiring the same lock. |
| **Configuration Updates** | Prevents conflicting writes to shared config values. |
| **Rate Limiting** | Ensures atomic updates to request counters. |
| **Concurrent Transactions** | Avoids lost updates when multiple clients modify the same key. |

Advantages of using CAS:

- **Ensures atomic updates** in distributed stores.
- **Prevents race conditions** when multiple clients write to the same key.
- **Guarantees strong consistency** by checking versioning before updating.
- **It can be used in leader election, distributed locks, and state coordination.**
- **Prevents lost updates** and ensures correct data modifications.

## Examples

The client provides specialized methods to execute CAS operations based on the value or revision:

### Distributed Queue Consumer Lock

Use Case: Multiple workers process tasks from a queue but each task should only be handled once

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="CLI">

Sets the initial value as usual if it hasn't been assigned previously:

```visual-basic
kahuna-cli>  set `locks/tasks/123` "node1" ex 10000 nx
r0 set 15ms
```

Mark the task as completed if this node still hold the key:

```visual-basic
kahuna-cli>  set `locks/tasks/123` "completed" cmp "node1"
r1 set 11ms
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="C#">

```csharp
using Kahuna.Client;

public async Task HandleTask(KahunaClient client, string taskId)
{
    string keyName = "locks/task/" + taskId;
    string machineName = Environment.MachineName;

    // Sets the initial value as usual if it hasn't been assigned previously
    (bool success, long revision) = await client.SetKeyValue(
        keyName,
        machineName,
        10000,
        KeyValueFlags.SetIfNotExists
    );

    if (!success)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Other node acquired the task");
        return;
    }

    // Process the task here
    // ...

    // Mark the task as completed if this node still hold the key
    (success, revision) = await client.TryCompareValueAndSetKeyValue(keyName, "completed", machineName, 0);

    if (success)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Marked as completed successfully");
        return;
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Feature Flag Update Control

Use Case: Update a feature flag, but only if it hasn’t changed since you last read it.

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="CLI">

Obtains the current value of the feature flag:

```visual-basic
get `feature/new-landing`
r0 disabled 12ms
```

Change the flag if the revision is still 0:

```visual-basic
kahuna-cli>  set `feature/new-landing` 'enabled' cmprev 0
r1 set 19ms
```

The flag won't change if the revision is not 0:

```visual-basic
kahuna-cli>  set `feature/new-landing` 'disabled' cmprev 0
r1 not set 14ms
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="C#">

```csharp
using Kahuna.Client;

public async Task CheckFeatureFlag(KahunaClient client, string featureName)
{
    string featureKey = "feature/" + featureName;

    // Obtains the current value of the feature flag
    (byte[]? _, long revision) = await client.GetKeyValue(featureKey);

    // ...

    // Check if the flag was changed
    (success, revision) = await client.TryCompareRevisionAndSetKeyValue(featureKey, "enabled", revision);

    if (success)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("No one else changed the flag between our read and write.");
        return;
    }
}
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
